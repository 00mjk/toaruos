# Contributing

**tl;dr:** Please don't.

とあるOS exists primarily for me to learn. I do not accept patches that add features or rewrite core systems or add new functionality. I sometimes accept patches with meta fixes - things like outdated README lines and such - but usually just take such pull requests as bug reports and fix them myself. If you are really dead-set on contributing to とあるOS, ask me first.
