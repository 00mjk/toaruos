# ToaruOS ld.so

This is a (work-in-progress) dynamic ELF linker/loader for ToaruOS.

What is in this repository now is very early and completely non-functional. It includes a Makefile which is capable of building some demo ELF shared libraries and the skeleton binary that will eventually become the loader, but is not currently capable of doing anything useful - come back later!
