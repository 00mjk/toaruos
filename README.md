# とあるOS Disk Image Creator

These scripts build disk images for とあるOS for use with your favorite non-multiboot emulator.

## Usage

Get a full working build of とあるOS, then clone this repository and run:

	sudo ./create-image.sh /path/to/your/toaru/source

Let it do its magic and you should have a `toaru-disk.img` that you can boot from.
