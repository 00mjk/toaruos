# ToaruOS ld.so

This is a (work-in-progress) dynamic ELF linker/loader for ToaruOS.

What is in this repository now is very early and completely non-functional. It includes a Makefile which is capable of building some demo ELF shared libraries and the skeleton binary that will eventually become the loader, but right now it can only load static binaries. Come back later!
