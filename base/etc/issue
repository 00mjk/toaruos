 This live CD has two available user accounts: \e{bold}local\e{reset} is listed in /etc/sudoers
 and \e{bold} guest\e{reset} is not. For both accounts, the password is the same as the account
 name. The \e{bold}root\e{reset} account can also be accessed directly with the password \e{bold}toor\e{reset}.
 You may also type \e{bold}restart\e{reset} at the login prompt to reboot. Please note that
 VGA text mode and serial terminal access provides only a limited subset of the
 available functionality of ToaruOS.
