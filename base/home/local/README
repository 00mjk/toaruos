Welcome to ToaruOS!

ToaruOS provides a familiar Unix-like environment, but please be aware that
the shell is incomplete and does not implement all Unix shell features. For
help with the shell's syntax and built-in functions, run `help`. For a list
of available commands, hit Tab twice. Tab completion is available for both
commands and file names.

To edit files, try using `bim` - a vi-like editor with syntax highlighting,
line and character selection, history stack, and tabs.

ToaruOS's compositing window server includes many common keybindings:
- Hold Alt to drag windows.
- Super (Win) combined with the arrow keys will "grid" windows to the sides
  or top and bottom of the screen. Combine with Ctrl and Shift for quarter-
  sized gridding.
- Alt-F10 maximized and unmaximizes windows.
- Alt-F4 closes windows.
