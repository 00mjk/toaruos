\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The ToAruOS Project}

This project was started in the winter of 2010-2011 with the goal of building, from scratch, a kernel and associated user-space designed with modern concepts and standardized hardware in mind. Throughout its development, the kernel has been expanded to include graphics support, a full-color ANSI-compatible terminal, VESA mode-switching support, EXT2 filesystem read support (to actual hard disks) and various other improvements.

\subsection{Roadmap}
